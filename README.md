## An implementation of BKTree in Cpp

### Introduction

This is a project that uses a Burkhard-Keller Tree (BK-Tree) to find similar words based on a given distance metric. 
This is particularly useful for applications like spell checking and autocorrection.
The code is implemented in C++ 20.

### Pre-requisites

- cmake (>=3.20)
- make (>=3.81)

### Building and Running

```shell
git clone https://github.com/H-Shen/BKTree.git
cd BKTree
rm -rf build
mkdir -p build
cd ./build
cmake ..
make
./output
```
